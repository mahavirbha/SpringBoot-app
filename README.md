# SpringBoot-app
Spring Boot App

Changes path code: (Somehow I got errors while puting relative paths in code)

In path /springBoot-appp/src/main/java/com/springBootApp/HashCSV/HashCSV.java update the file path on line 11 with file path of out4.csv

In path /springBoot-app/src/main/java/com/springBootApp/CSV/ReadDataFromCSV.java update the file path on line 17 with file path of latest.csv

In path /springBoot-app/src/main/java/com/springBootApp/CSV/ReadDataFromCSV.java update the file path on line 54 and 57 with file path of output.json
